Data pre-processing for Machine learning models.

Split your data into training and testing sets.

Handle missing data (if necessary).

Encode categorical variables using one-hot encoding (if applicable).

Choose between normalization or standardization based on your data and algorithm.

Apply the chosen scaling technique to both your training and testing sets (important! Don't fit the scaler on the test set).
